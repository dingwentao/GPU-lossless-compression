# GPU-Accelerated Lossless Compression Survey

This repository suveys state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated lossless compressors. The evaluation is conductd using an NVIDIA V100 GPU (16 GB memory). Besides lossless compression survey, another purpose for this survey is to identify suitable GPU-accelerated lossless compressor for our developed CUDA-based lossy compressor (called cuSZ), which can be accessed at https://github.com/szcompressor/cuSZ. Please feel free to contact me (dingwen.tao@wsu.edu) if you find any issue or any lossless compressor that has not been covered in this survey. 

## **BZIP/BWT Family**

### 1. CUDPP - CUDA Data-Parallel Primitives Library

Abstract: CUDPP release 2.1 is a feature release that adds many new parallel primitives. We have added cudppCompress, a lossless data compression algorithm. This compression utilizes efficient parallel Burrows-Wheeler and Move-to-Front transforms (BTW) which are also exposed through the API. GPU implementation is dominated by BWT performance and is 2.78× slower than bzip2, with BWT and MTF-Huffman respectively 2.89x and 1.34x slower.

### 3. Parallel Variable-Length Encoding on GPGPUs

Abstract: bzip2-cuda is a parallel version of the BZip2 lossless data compression algorithm using NVIDIA's CUDA, with the aim of improving compression/decompression speed, leaving the compression ratio intact. bzip2 compression program is based on Burrows–Wheeler algorithm.

### 4. Fast Burrows Wheeler Compression Using All-Cores (Heterogeneous)

Abstract: We present an all-core implementation of Burrows Wheeler Compression algorithm that exploits all computing resources on a system. We develop a fast GPU BWC algorithm by extending the state-of-the-art GPU string sort to efficiently perform BWT step of BWC. Our hybrid BWC with GPU acceleration achieves a 2.9× speedup over best CPU implementation.

**Compression ratio = 4.4**

Note: The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional data except the position of the first original character. The BWT is thus a "free" method of improving the efficiency of text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation. bzip2 is a free and open-source file compression program that uses the Burrows–Wheeler algorithm.

## **Huffman Family**

### 5. E2MC - Entropy Encoding Based Memory Compression for GPUs

Abstract: We propose an entropy encoding based memory compression (E2MC) technique for GPUs, which is based on the well-known Huffman encoding. We study the feasibility of entropy encoding for GPUs and show that it achieves higher compression ratios than state-of-the-art GPU compression techniques. Furthermore, we address the key challenges of probability estimation, choosing an appropriate symbol length for encoding, and decompression with low latency.
